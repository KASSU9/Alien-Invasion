The controls for the game are:
-arrow keys for moving left and right
-spacebar for shooting
-f for shooting missiles
-q for exiting the game

The game has boss levels every 5 levels. If you want to explore this quickly, you can modify the bullet width in the settings file to 1920 pixels to quickly defeat the first levels.
Additionally, you can set bullet_breaks = False in the same file to clear every level with one shot

The game is intended to be played in 1920x1080p other resolutions might misalign the visible UI and the amount of aliens spawning is not consistent.

NOTE 
The base game is made with the instuctions of Eric Matthes in his book Python Crash Course 2nd Edition. Additionally, the game consists of modifications made by me.
This code was mostly written in 2020-2021 and minor modifications were made on 6.1.2024
